# Analyze-International-Debt-Statistics

* SQL is used throughout this project.

We will evaluate international debt statistics provided by The World Bank in this notebook.
The dataset offers information on the amount of debt owed by developing nations in several categories (in USD).
We'll look for responses to queries like:


* How much debt do the nations represented in the dataset owe collectively?

* Which nation has the most debt, and what is the size of that debt?

* What is the average debt owed by nations across various debt indicators?
